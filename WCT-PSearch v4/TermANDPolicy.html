        <p>
            To become a good student is a matter of patience and routine work. So to become a good student first of all one should make a routine of oneâ€™s 
            daily activities and act according to it. He should be regular to his studies. He should read at least 6 hours a day.  He should attend his 
            classes regularly. He should try to understand what he is taught and what he reads. If he faces any problem, he should discuss it with his 
            teachers. A good student makes his own notes. After completing a note once, he should check and re-check them frequently. Thus a standard note 
            is prepared. He should write more and more and prepare himself for the exams. A good student always keeps good relationship with his classmates. 
            He takes help from the bright students and helps the weak ones. He should not mix with the bad students. He should have respect for his parents, 
            teachers and elders. All these may help a student greatly to become a good student.
