        <p>
            We are ITE students from Faculty of Engineering at Royal University of Phom Penh. We have formed a group which in group 04 
            for doing a website for WCT group assignment and we come up with an idea to create a website named P-Search. 
            <br> <br>
            Group 04: P-Search consists 5 members are
            <ol>1. Heng Titi</ol>

            Introduction
        </h1>
        <p>
            As you might already know that google is the most used search engine for many people around the world. Most students are 
            using google for their research in many forms such as research paper, articles images and videos. Even though google give 
            you the option to find many stock images and photos, most of the images aren’t really professional and beautiful. This is 
            why we are going to introduce you to our new Project call P-Search.
            <br> <br>
            P-Search is a website where you can find many professional photos, and used freely under our license. Photos in P_search 
            can be download and used for commercial and non-commercial purpose. There’s no permission needed, even though giving credit 
            to the creator would be appreciate.
        </p>
        <h1>Why do we create P-Search?</h1>
        <p>
            There are multiple reasons to why we come up with this project. Due to our observation on most students, we can see that 
            they mostly find stock image in order to use for their slide presentation and reports by using google search engine. And 
            as you may know, images and photos from google are not nice. Also, you don’t know whether the images you download from 
            google are under any license. Even though, most of the creator won’t sue you for using their photos for study, some will 
            not be happy about it.
        </p>
        <h1>Our Vision</h1>
        <p>This is the reason why we create this project up:</p>
        <li>Students can use images from our website completely free due to our license with the creator.</li>
        <li>Increase more opportunity for photographer to share their works.</li>
        <li>We also think about those who start their work in the creative fields as well as developer.</li>
